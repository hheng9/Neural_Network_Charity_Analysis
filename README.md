# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis
### This analysis involves creating a binary classifier using a dataset of 34,000 organizations that received funding from Alphabet Soup. The goal is to preprocess the data, compile, train, and evaluate a neural network model to predict if an applicant will be successful. The article discusses the differences between traditional machine learning classification, regression models, neural network models, perceptron model, and algorithm performance. We use TensorFlow to create and train machine learning models, particularly neural networks, with a flexible and efficient architecture, and to deploy them on various platforms.
